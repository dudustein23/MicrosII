# Rhythm_Control
Cadence control for high-level cyclists with visual alerts!
This project is part of the Microprocessed Systems II course, where we were asked to create a project that could be implemented in some activity of our daily lives.
A magnetic sensor was used, which generates a pulse every time a pedal rotation from the cyclist is detected. With an integrated circuit (IC), we captured all pedal strokes, and using PWM and OC, visual alerts and warnings were controlled using LEDs.
